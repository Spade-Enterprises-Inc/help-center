### **Contract Phase (Non-editable)**

- **Active**: The deal is currently in effect (i.e., today's date is between the contract's start and end dates).
- **Future**: The deal is set to start in the future (i.e., today's date is before the contract's start date).
- **Expired**: The deal has ended (i.e., today's date is after the contract's end date).
- **None**: The deal does not have a contract start date.

### **Contract Status**

- **Signed**: The deal is officially agreed upon and signed.
- **Draft**: The deal is being drafted and not yet finalized.
- **Unqualified**: The deal is not proceeding (useful when evaluating multiple options).
- **Terminated**: The deal has been ended.

### **Deal Type**

- **Renewal**: For deals that are being renewed.
- **Net New**: For entirely new deals or suppliers.

### **Form Status (Non-editable)**

- **Unavailable**: Not available yet or no set kickoff date.
- **Available**: Renewal form becomes available for completion 7 days before the kickoff date.

- **Overdue**: Not submitted within 14 days after the kickoff date.
- **Submitted**: The form has been completed and submitted.

### **Deal Process Recommendation**

- **Stakeholder Input**: Stakeholders provide their recommendation for a deal while completing the renewal form. This reflects their opinion on the action procurement should take regarding the deal. The recommendation entered on the renewal form will automatically update the deal profile's recommendation once the form is submitted.
    
    Upon reviewing the deal profile after the form submission, the procurement team can then set the "Deal Process" to either align with the "Deal Process Recommendation" or not. This distinction is designed to help track the difference between the stakeholder's initial submission and the active process procurement ends up pursuing.
    
- **Procurement Input**: During the renewal of a deal, the procurement team can directly set a recommendation for the next renewal period. When the subsequent renewal form is sent to stakeholders, this recommendation is pre-populated, allowing stakeholders to either retain or modify it.
- **Recommendations**:
    - **Renew**: Recommendation to continue with the current deal.
    - **Replace**: Recommendation to find a new supplier.
    - **Terminate**: Recommendation to end the deal.
    - **Evaluate**: Recommendation to reassess the deal.
