Headcount breakdowns provide insights into a supplier's operational capacity and resource allocation across key areas like R&D, sales, and support. You can use this information to assess whether the supplier has the workforce to meet demand and provide adequate support. It also indicates stability and growth, offering clues about the supplier’s long-term viability and capability to deliver.

Revenue Sankey diagrams visually depict how a supplier's revenue is distributed across products and the business, offering insight into the supplier's business priorities. You can use this information to assess the supplier’s financial health and identify risks, such as reliance on certain product areas or increased sales and marketing spend over R&D.
