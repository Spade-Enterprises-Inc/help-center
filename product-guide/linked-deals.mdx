The Linked Deals tab streamlines how you view and manage the relationships between your deals, particularly for renewals and replacements. This feature enhances strategic planning and deal oversight by showcasing connections between current, past, and future deals.

- **Replacement**: When you initiate evaluations for potential replacements, these are linked back to the original deal, and vice versa. For example, if Salesforce is being considered for replacement with evaluations for Hubspot and Microsoft Dynamics, these evaluations will be accessible from Salesforceâ€™s Linked Deals tab. Conversely, navigating to the Linked Deals tab for either evaluation (Hubspot or Microsoft Dynamics) will show a link back to the Salesforce deal.
- **Renewal:** Similar to a replacement, when you create a renewal, the new deal is linked to its originating deal and vice versa.

This enhances the visibility and tracking of deal lifecycles by helping the team aggregate evaluation and renewal information in one place.
