title: Stakeholder Form
---

The Stakeholder Form is a critical tool during the renewal process, enabling stakeholders to submit necessary information that updates the deal profile for Procurementâ€™s review.

**Accessing the form**

- **Stakeholder:** When it's time to evaluate a renewal, stakeholders will receive an email containing a link to the Stakeholder Form. Access is restricted to the form and the alternatives tab.
- **Procurement**: The Stakeholder Form is always available to procurement via the Deal Profile.

**Form Sections**

The Stakeholder Form is divided into three main sections, each designed to convey and capture specific types of information:

1. **Deal Information**
   - This section provides an overview of the contract details. It is presented for informational purposes only and cannot be edited by Stakeholders. If Procurement needs to update any information in this section, edits can be made to the corresponding field on the deal profile.
2. **Recommendation**
   - Stakeholders are asked to suggest a course of action for the deal: evaluate, renew, replace, or terminate. This includes identifying relevant decision-makers, ensuring that the recommendation is directed to the appropriate parties for further action.
3. **Reasoning**
   - The form dynamically adjusts to the recommended action, prompting stakeholders to provide detailed reasoning. For instance a termination recommendation requires details such as the reason for termination and contact information whereas a renewal recommendation calls for information on business impact, proposal details, and more.

**Submission**

Information entered in the Stakeholder Form is directly linked to the deal's Profile tab. Upon submission, the form automatically updates the profile with the new data, streamlining the renewal process and ensuring that the deal profile remains current and accurate.

If a stakeholder needs to edit their submission, they can simply re-open the link from their email and resubmit the form.
