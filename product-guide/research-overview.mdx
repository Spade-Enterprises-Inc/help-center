## Taxonomy Overview

The Airflip taxonomy is broken into Departments, Parent Categories, Child Categories, Suppliers, and Leaders.

### Departments

Departments represent broad functional areas within a business, such as Marketing, Sales, or IT. Research is tailored to the needs and challenges typically encountered in each department.

### Parent Categories

Parent categories define common business problems that child categories help solve. These are generally used for broad, platform-based solutions. A category is classified as a parent if it has a parent-child relationship with other categories. For example Quote Management Software is a parent category that contains CPQ Software, Quote-to-Cash Software, Proposal Software and Pricing Software.

### Child Categories

Child categories usually refer to more specialized, "point solutions" that address specific business needs. Child categories are either linked to a parent category or act as a standalone categories. For example, Conversation Intelligence Software is a child category under Sales Accelleration Software.

### Vendor Products

The research focuses at the product level. Each product is evaluated based on its performance in a specific category. For example, Salesforce Sales Cloud could be a leader in Sales Automation, while Salesforce Marketing Cloud could be dominant in Marketing Automation. Vendor products are mapped to the companies they belong to, and research typically highlights solutions rather than individual product features.

### Suppliers

Suppliers are companies or organizational entities that offer various products. A company may have one or more associated products within different categories. For example, both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud are products offered by the supplier Salesforce.

### Market Leaders

Leaders are products identified by our prorietary research as top performers within a specific category. For example, ZoomInfo Sales might be a leader in both Sales Intelligence and Buyer Intent Data Software, with separate research for each category.

### Category Criteria

Each category has key themes and functionalities to consider when evaluating a solution. There are two types of criteria:

- **Bespoke Criteria:** These vary by category (e.g., features specific to CRM software).
- **Standard Criteria:** Common across all categories (e.g., pricing, implementation, support, integrations).

Each criterion includes internal questions to ask your team and external questions to ask vendors during the evaluation process.

### RFX

This dynamic table shows all category crieria, inteneral and vendor questions for all categories assocaited with a supplier. Select a category from the drop down and view key features to evaluation along with internal questions to ask your team and external questions to ask the vendor.

### Intelligence

Explore insights such as expected headcount by department and revenue breakdowns via Sankey diagrams to make informed decisions about the supplier's viability for your needs.

Headcount breakdowns provide insights into a supplier's operational capacity and resource allocation across key areas like R&D, sales, and support. You can use this information to assess whether the supplier has the workforce to meet demand and provide adequate support. It also indicates stability and growth, giving clues about the supplier’s long-term viability and capability to deliver.

Revenue Sankey diagrams visually depict how a supplier's revenue is distributed across products and the business, offering insight into the supplier's business priorities. You can use this information to assess the supplier’s financial health and identify risks, such as reliance on certain product areas or increased sales and marketing spend over R&D.
