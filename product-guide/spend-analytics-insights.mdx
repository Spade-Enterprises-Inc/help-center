This section lists all your suppliers with the following key details:

By clicking on any supplier, youâ€™ll be directed to a detailed **Supplier Page** with further insights (see Supplier Page documentation for more details).

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Review Key Suppliers**: Sort your suppliers by total spend, revenue, or categories. Click into individual supplier profiles for a more detailed analysis of assigned categories, intelligence, and alternatives.
2. **Supplier Benchmarking**: Filter by Primary Category or Assigned Categories to compare two suppliers across total spend, employee count, and revenue. This high-level benchmarking exercise helps you make data-driven decisions when negotiating pricing.
