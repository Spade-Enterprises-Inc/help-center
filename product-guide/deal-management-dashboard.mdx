### **Sorting**

The dashboard supports sorting by date, number, and text. This feature enables you to organize your supplier deals in a way that best suits your needs, whether you want to view the most recent deals first, sort by the contract amount, or alphabetically by supplier name. To sort a column:

- **Single Click** on the column header to sort in ascending order.
- **Click again** on the same column header to sort in descending order.
- **Click again** on the same column header to remove the sort.

To sort across multiple columns, hold down the Shift button and click additional column headers.

### **Filtering**

Our multi-filter approach allows you to combine different filter types across any of your selected columns. This is particularly useful for narrowing down your view to specific deals based on various criteria, such as deal status, supplier category, or any other relevant data point. Airflip supports filtering across dates, text and numbers.

### Dates

- **Access the Filter**: Click the **filter icon** next to the date column you want to refine.
- **Select Your Criteria**: Choose from options like "equals," "before," "after," and more to narrow down your dates. You can even select "blank" or "not blank" to filter based on empty or filled fields.
- **Combine Filters (Optional)**: Need to narrow it down further? Add another filter to the same column and decide whether to use "AND" (both conditions must be met) or "OR" (either condition works).

### **Text**

- **Access the Filter**: Click the **filter icon** in your desired text column.
- **Select Your Criteria**: Check the boxes for the text values you want to appear. You can select multiple boxes; this works like an "OR" filter, showing rows that match any of your chosen values.

### **Numbers**

- **Access the Filter**: Click the **filter icon** in the column with numbers.
- **Select Your Criteria**: Pick from options like "greater than," "less than," "equals," and more to filter your number column. "Between" is great for specifying a range, and "blank" or "not blank" help filter based on empty or filled cells.
- **Combine Filters (Optional)**: For even more precision, add a second filter on the same column. Decide if you want both conditions to apply ("AND") or just one ("OR").

### **Grouping and Aggregation**

Grouping allows you to organize your deals by categories such as Department or Vendor name.

- To group your deals, drag and drop any column header into the grouping area above the table or expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any column to the Row Group area.

- When you group data, our dashboard provides the option to aggregate information within each group. This means you can see sums, averages, counts, or other aggregate functions applied to numerical data, providing a quick overview of the metrics that matter most to your procurement processes.

- To aggregate your grouped data, expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any numeric column to the Values area. Make sure to select the type of aggregation you would like to see, such as “sum”, “average” etc.

### **Pinning Columns**

To ensure you always have access to the most critical data, our dashboard allows you to pin columns. Pinned columns remain visible on the screen as you scroll horizontally, making it easier to reference key information while reviewing other data.

- To pin a column, click on the column header you wish to pin and drag it to the left or right of the page. When you see the pin icon, drop the column and it will be successfully pinned.

### **Column Selection**

Customize your view by selecting which columns to display on the dashboard. This feature allows you to focus on the data that is most relevant to your current needs, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

- Expand the vertical column selector on the right side of the table and select or deselect columns from your view. You can also drag and drop items in this list to change their order.

### **Quick Filter**

The quick filter provides a way to rapidly filter the data displayed on the dashboard based on a keyword or phrase. This filter is temporary and does not persist once you navigate away from the page, making it perfect for quick searches. Enter your search term in the Quick Filter text box above the table and the table will update to display only the rows that match your search criteria.

## **Persistence of Settings**

Your sorting preferences, filters (except the quick filter), grouping configurations, pinned columns, and column selections will persist when you leave and return to the page. This means you can pick up right where you left off, saving time and maintaining your workflow's continuity.
