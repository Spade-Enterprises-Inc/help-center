This dynamic spreadsheet displays all your spend data in a tabular format. By default, your spend transactions are grouped into Category Level 1 > Category Level 2 > Category Level 3 > Granular Category > Supplierby Level 1.

Easily sort, filter, group, and aggregate your spend data with the following features:

### Sorting

Spend data can be sorted by date, number, or text:

- **Single click**: Sorts in ascending order.
- **Second click**: Sorts in descending order.
- **Third click**: Removes sorting.
- **Multi-column sorting**: Hold `Shift` and click on additional column headers to sort multiple columns simultaneously.

### Filtering

The spreadsheet supports flexible filtering options across dates, text, and numbers:

**Dates**

1. **Access the filter**: Click the three-line filter icon in the top right corner of any date column.
2. **Filter criteria**: Choose from options such as "Before," "After," or end in a specific date range.
3. **Combine filters**: Apply multiple filters with "AND" or "OR" options for greater precision.

**Text**

1. **Access the filter**: Click the three-line filter icon in the top right corner of any text column.
2. **Filter criteria**: You can filter by options such as “Contains,” “Does Not Contain,” “Equals,” “Does Not Equal,” “Begins With,” “Ends With,” “Blank,” or “Not Blank.”
3. **Combine filters**: Apply multiple filters with "AND" or "OR" options for greater precision.

**Numbers**

1. **Access the filter**: Click the three-line filter icon in the top right corner of any number column.
2. **Select criteria**: Filter based on ranges or specific values, such as "greater than" or "between."
3. **Combine filters**: Apply multiple filters with "AND" or "OR" options for greater precision.

### **Grouping**

Grouping allows you to organize your spend by different columns such as categories, departments, or suppliers.

To group your data, drag and drop any column header into the grouping area above the table, or expand the column selector on the right-hand side of the table and drag any column to the Row Group area.

### **Aggregation**

When you group data, our dashboard provides the option to aggregate information within each group. This means you can see sums, averages, or counts applied to numerical data, providing a quick overview of the metrics that matter most to your procurement processes.

To aggregate your grouped data, expand the column selector on the right-hand side of the table and drag any numeric column to the Values area. Make sure to select the type of aggregation you would like to see, such as “sum,” “average,” etc.

### **Pinning Columns**

To ensure you always have access to the most critical data, our dashboard allows you to pin columns. Pinned columns remain visible on the screen as you scroll horizontally, making it easier to reference key information while reviewing other data.

To pin a column, click on the column header you wish to pin and drag it to the left or right of the page. When you see the pin icon, drop the column, and it will be successfully pinned.

### **Column Selection**

Customize your view by selecting which columns to display on the dashboard. Expand the vertical column selector on the right side of the table and select or deselect columns from your view. You can also drag and drop items in this list to change their order.

## **View Management**

### **Default Views**

By default, Airflip provides you with three default views in your Spreadsheet.

1. **Default**: Groups your spend transactions into Category Level 1 > Category Level 2 > Category Level 3 > Granular Category > Supplier.
2. **All Transactions**: Shows all your spend transactions sorted by Total Amount. No groups or filters are applied.
3. **Suppliers**: Groups all spend transactions by Supplier name.

### **Create and Save Views**

A view represents a set of saved table settings. You can create and save new views by:

1. Selecting your desired columns, sorts, filters, and aggregations.
2. Clicking the Eye icon above the table.
3. Selecting ‘Create new view’ to create a separate view or ‘Update current view’ to change the settings of your current view.

### **Duplicate Views**

Duplicate existing views and use them as templates for new views. This feature is a time-saver and promotes consistency in data analysis approaches across various projects and teams.

1. Start with a view you would like to duplicate and click the Eye icon.
2. Click ‘Create new view.’ This will copy all of the current view settings into a new view.

### **Delete and Rename Views**

Manage your views effectively by deleting outdated views and renaming current ones to better reflect ongoing changes in business strategies and user needs.

1. Click the Eye icon, followed by ‘Edit Views.’
2. Click the Pencil icon to edit the view name, or the Trash icon to delete the view. Please note that default views cannot be renamed or deleted.

### **Data Persistence and Reversion**

Airflip ensures that any unsaved changes you make to your view settings are not lost when you reload the page, navigate back to your table using the back button, or log out and back in; your most recent settings will persist.

To revert any unsaved changes and return to the last saved state of a view, simply click the circular arrow icon on the right-hand side above the table. This action will restore your view to its previously saved configuration.
