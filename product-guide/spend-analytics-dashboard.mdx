The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your spend data, organized into the following tabs:

- **Overview**: Gain high-level insights into overall spend.
- **Supplier**: Analyze spend by supplier.
- **Category**: Break down spend by category.
- **Cost Center**: Visualize spend across various cost centers.

You can interact with your dashboard's spend data through filters and click-throughs.

### Applying Filters

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll find various filters that allow you to dynamically update the charts below. You can filter by:

- **Payment Date**: The specific date on which the payment for a transaction was made.
- **Spend Amount**: The monetary value of a transaction, which can be filtered to show amounts greater than, less than, or equal to a specified amount.
- **Spend Method**: The method used to make the payment, such as invoice or credit card.
- **Categories**: Hierarchical groupings of spend data, divided into Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and a more detailed AI-generated granular category.
- **Supplier**: The name of the vendor or company providing the goods or services.
- **Managed**: A label indicating whether the spend is classified as "managed." A value of True indicates "managed" and a value of False indicates "not managed."
- **Domain**: The supplier's domain, typically used for identification or matching purposes.

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Category Spend Analysis**: You are tasked with seeing how much your company spent on IT over the past three months. Select the Category tab on the dashboard. Filter the dashboard by Payment Date equals Last 3 Months and Category Level 1 equals Information Technology (IT). The charts update to display the trends across the Information Technology (IT) category for the specified time range. You can review the Information Technology (IT) category’s subcategories in the Category Level 2 and Level 3 spend charts.
2. **Supplier Spend Review**: You are preparing for a quarterly review and need to evaluate the top 10 suppliers by spend. Select the Supplier tab on the dashboard. Filter the dashboard by Payment Date equals Past Quarter. Review the Spend by Supplier chart to quickly see the highest spending suppliers over the past quarter.
    
    Similarly, you could also remove all filters, scroll down to the Supplier Spend Over Time chart, and hover over the quarter in question to see the top spend by supplier.
    

### Interacting with Dashboard Charts

All bar charts and line charts in the dashboard are interactive:

- **Click on a chart section**: Clicking on a specific portion of a chart will update the filters at the top of the page and update the other charts and tables on the page accordingly.
    
    The Pareto Analysis Chart and stacked bar charts are not interactive.
    
- **Review contributing line items**: Any filters applied via the filters at the top of the page or by clicking on a specific portion of a chart will update the ‘All Transactions’ table at the bottom of the page. This table allows you to see the contributing transactions on a line-by-line basis.

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Deep Dive into Cost Center Spend**: You are investigating a spike in the Hosting and Network cost center's spending. Click on the Cost Center tab on the dashboard. Filter for your cost center by clicking on the Hosting and Network item in the Total Spend by Chart of Accounts pie chart. Scroll down to the All Transactions table to see the contributing transactions. You can subsequently narrow these transactions down further by adding more filters at the top of the page, such as payment date or spend method.
2. **Category Manager Supplier-Specific Investigation**: You are a category manager for Sales and Marketing Software. You want to see if there are any opportunities to reduce spending. Click on the Supplier tab in the dashboard. Filter by Sales and Marketing Category Level 1 to see the top supplier spend. Choose a supplier to investigate and add the name to the Supplier filter.
    
    Navigate to the Categories tab and note that your filters on supplier name and Category Level 1 will persist. From here, you can use the Category Level 2 and Level 3 bar charts to see if the supplier is contributing significantly more spend to certain subcategories than others. Scrolling down to the table view, you can review individual transactions to find potential renegotiation opportunities.
