The Spend Analytics module provides comprehensive insights into your organization's spending patterns through interactive dashboards, dynamic spreadsheets, and AI-driven opportunities analysis.

# Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your spend data, brokend down into the following tabs:

- **Overview**: Gain high-level insights into overall spend.
- **Supplier**: Analyze spend by supplier.
- **Category**: Breakdown spend by category.
- **Cost Center**: Visualize spend across various cost centers.

You can interact with your Dashboard spend data through filters and click throughs.

### Applying Filters

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll find various filters that allow you to dynamically update the charts below. You can filter by:

- **Payment Date**: The specific date on which the payment for a transaction was made.
- **Spend Amount**: The monetary value of a transaction, which can be filtered to show amounts greater than, less than, or equal to a specified amount.
- **Spend Method**: The method used to make the payment, such as invoice or credit card.
- **Categories**: Hierarchical groupings of spend data, divided into Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and a more detailed AI-generated granular category.
- **Supplier**: The name of the vendor or company providing the goods or services.
- **Managed**: A label indicating whether the spend is classified as "managed". A value of True is "managed" and a value of False is "not managed".
- **Domain**: The supplier's domain, typically used for identification or matching purposes.

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Category Spend Analysis**: You are tasked with seeing how much your company spent on IT over the past three months. Select the Category tab on the Dashboard. Filter the dashboard by Payment Date equals Last 3 Months and Category Level 1 equals Information Technology (IT). The charts update to display the trends across the Information Technology (IT) category for the specified time range. You can review the Information Technology (IT) category’s sub categories in the Category Level 2 and Level 3 Spend charts.
2. **Supplier Spend Review**: You are preparing for a quarterly review and need to evaluate the top 10 suppliers by spend. Select the Supplier tab on the Dashboard. Filter the dashboard by Payment Date equals Past Quarter. Review the Spend by Supplier chart to quickly see the highest spend suppliers over the past quarter.
    
    Similarly you could also remove all filters, scroll down to the Supplier Spend Over Time chart and hover over the quarter in question to see the top spend by supplier.

### Interacting with Dashboard Charts

All bar charts and line charts the dashboard are interactive:

- **Click on a chart section**: Clicking on a specific portion of a chart will update the filters at the top of the page. For example, clicking on a segment of bar chart will narrow the data to just that supplier or category, updating all other charts and tables on the page accordingly.
    
    The Pareto Analysis Chart and stacked bar charts are not interactive. 
    
- **Review contributing line items:** Any filters applied vie the filters at the top of the page or via clicking on a specific portion of a chart will update the ‘All Transactions’ table at the bottom of the page. This table allows you to see the contributing transactions on a line by line basis.

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Deep Dive into Cost Center Spend**: You are investigating a spike in the Hosting and Network cost center's spending. Click on the cost center tab on the Dashboard. Filter for your cost center by clikcing into the Hosting and Network item in the Total Spend by Chart of Accounts pie chart. Scroll down to the All Transactions table to see the contributing transactions. You can subsequently narrow these transactions down further by adding more filters at the top of the page such as payment date or spend method. 
2. **Category Manager Supplier-Specific Investigation**: You are a category manger for Sales and Marketing Software. You want to see if there are any opportunities to reduce spend. Click on the Supplier tab in the Dashboard. Filter by Sales and Marketing Category Level 1 to see the top supplier spend. Choose a supplier to investigate and add the name to the Supplier filter. 
    
    Navigate to the Categories tab and note that your filters on supplier name and category level 1 will persist. From here you can use the Category Level 2 and Level 3 bar charts to see if the supplier is contributing significantly more spend to certain subcategories over others. Scrolling down to the table view you can review individual transactions to find potential renegotiation opportunities.

# Spreadsheet

### **Grouping and Aggregation**

Grouping allows you to organize your spend by different columns such as categories, department or supplier.

- To group your deals, drag and drop any column header into the grouping area above the table or expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any column to the Row Group area.

When you group data, our dashboard provides the option to aggregate information within each group. This means you can see sums, averages or counts applied to numerical data, providing a quick overview of the metrics that matter most to your procurement processes. 

- To aggregate your grouped data, expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any numeric column to the Values area. Make sure to select the type of aggregation you would like to see, such as “sum”, “average” etc.

### **Pinning Columns**

To ensure you always have access to the most critical data, our dashboard allows you to pin columns. Pinned columns remain visible on the screen as you scroll horizontally, making it easier to reference key information while reviewing other data.

- To pin a column, click on the column header you wish to pin and drag it to the left or right of the page. When you see the pin icon, drop the column and it will be successfully pinned.

### **Column Selection**

Customize your view by selecting which columns to display on the dashboard. This feature allows you to focus on the data that is most relevant to your current needs, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

- Expand the vertical column selector on the right side of the table and select or deselect columns from your view. You can also drag and drop items in this list to change their order.

## **View Management**

### **Default Views**

By default, Airflip provides you with three default views in your Spreadsheet.

1. **Default**: Groups your spend transactions into Category Level 1 > Category Level 2 > Category Level 3 > Granular Category > Supplier.
2. **All Transactions:** Shows all spend transactions on the Airflip tool sorted by Total Amount. No groups or filter are applied.
3. **Suppliers:** Groups all spend transactions by supplier name.

### **Create and Save Views**

A view represents a set of saved table settings tailored to specific criteria. You can create and save new views by:

1. Select your desired columns, sorts, filters, and aggregations. 
2. Select the Eye icon above the table.
3. Click ‘Create new view’ to create a separate view or ‘Update current view’ to change the settings of your current view. 

### **Duplicate Views**

Duplicate existing views and use them as templates for new views. This feature is a time-saver and promotes consistency in data analysis approaches across various projects and teams. 

1. Start with a view you would like to duplicate and click the Eye icon. 
2. Click ‘Create new view’. This will copy all of the current view settings into a new view. 

### **Delete and Rename Views**

Manage your views effectively by deleting outdated views and renaming current ones to better reflect the ongoing changes in business strategies and user needs. 

1. Click the Eye icon, followed by ‘Edit Views’.
2. Click the Pencil icon to edit the view name, or the Trash icon to delete the view. Please note that default views cannot be renamed or deleted.

### **Data Persistence and Reversion**

Airflip ensures that any unsaved changes you make to your view settings are not lost when you reload the page, navigate back to your table using the back button or log out and back in; your most recent settings will persist. 

To revert any unsaved changes and return to the last saved state of a view, simply click the circle arrow icon on the right hand side above the table. This action will restore your view to its previously saved configuration.

# Opportunities

The Opportunities tab provides valuable insights into how vendor categories and suppliers are utilized across your organization and where improvements can be made.

By analyzing your spend transactions alongside our proprietary category taxonomy and research, our AI-driven insights infer supplier and category usage. These insights are displayed in the "Likelihood of Use" column:

- **Likely**: High likelihood of supplier spend being tied to the category, with reasoning based on transaction line items.
- **Possible**: Potential association between the supplier's spend and the category, drawn from both spend data and supplier information.
- **Sourcing Opportunity**: No direct spend association with the category, but our research identifies the supplier as a leader in that category, and you have an existing relationship with them. For example, if you’re reviewing the Partnerships Management software category and have a contract with Salesforce for CRM Software, Salesforce would appear as a "Sourcing Opportunity," suggesting you could expand your contract to include Partnerships Management.

The data is available in two views: by **Category** and by **Supplier**.

### By Category

The **Category View** allows you to explore spend opportunities by specific categories, identifying which suppliers from your transactions are linked to each category. This helps you better understand spending patterns and the key suppliers associated with various categories.

The ‘Filer Categories by Supplier’ lets you filter categories by supplier alongside the other suppliers within the same categories. This allows for a comprehensive view of all categories where a supplier operates or has a sourcing opportunity.

![Opportunities Categories Suppier Filter](/images/Opportunities_Categories_SupplierSearch.png)

**Examples**:

1. **Identify Categories with Sourcing Opportunities**: Use the filter in the 'Grouped Columns' column to search for a specific category. Expand the category row to view all associated suppliers and check for any sourcing opportunities.
    
    To see all categories with sourcing opportunities, clear all other filters and set the 'Likelihood of Use' filter to "Sourcing Opportunities."
    
2. **Analyze Sales Engagement Consolidation Opportunities**: Filter the 'Grouped Columns' for the Sales Engagement Software category. Expand the category to review suppliers marked as "Likely" to provide sales engagement services. This may reveal opportunities to consolidate suppliers and avoid duplication of services.

### By Supplier

The **Supplier View** enables you to focus on individual suppliers, exploring the categories they may be associated with based on your spend data. This is helpful for evaluating a supplier’s potential across multiple categories, whether for expanding relationships or consolidating services.

![Opportunities Categories Suppier Filter](/images/Opportunities_Suppliers.png)

**Examples**:

1. **Evaluate Supplier Use in a Category**: To assess whether a supplier is used for a particular category, filter by the supplier name in the 'Grouped Columns' and review all entries where the 'Likelihood of Use' is "Likely."
2. **Discover New Opportunities with a Supplier**: If you are approaching a renewal or negotiation with a supplier, filter by the supplier and look for rows marked as "Sourcing Opportunity". This indicates the supplier is a category leader and expanding the scope of the supplier contract to this category may be a viable alternative to a higher-cost supplier.

# Supplier Insights

This section lists all your suppliers with the following key details:

- **Total Spend**
- **Primary Category**
- **Total Categories Assigned**
- **Revenue**
- **Employees**
- **Founded Year**

By clicking on any supplier, you’ll be directed to a detailed **Supplier Page** with further insights (see Supplier Page documentation for more details).

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Review Key Suppliers**: Sort your suppliers by total spend, revenue or categores. Click into individual supplier profiles for a more detailed analysis on  assigned categories, intelligence and alternatives. 
2. **Supplier Benchmarking**: Filter by Primary Category or Assigned Categories to compare two suppliers across total spend, employee count, and revenue. This high level benchmarking exercise helps you understand them make data-driven decisions when negotiating pricing.
