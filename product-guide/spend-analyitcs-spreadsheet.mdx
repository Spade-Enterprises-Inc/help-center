Spend data can be sorted by date, number, or text:

- **Single click**: Sorts in ascending order.

### **Grouping and Aggregation**

Grouping allows you to organize your spend by different columns such as categories, department or supplier.

- To group your deals, drag and drop any column header into the grouping area above the table or expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any column to the Row Group area.

When you group data, our dashboard provides the option to aggregate information within each group. This means you can see sums, averages or counts applied to numerical data, providing a quick overview of the metrics that matter most to your procurement processes. 

- To aggregate your grouped data, expand the column selector on the right hand side of the table and drag any numeric column to the Values area. Make sure to select the type of aggregation you would like to see, such as “sum”, “average” etc.

### **Pinning Columns**

To ensure you always have access to the most critical data, our dashboard allows you to pin columns. Pinned columns remain visible on the screen as you scroll horizontally, making it easier to reference key information while reviewing other data.

- To pin a column, click on the column header you wish to pin and drag it to the left or right of the page. When you see the pin icon, drop the column and it will be successfully pinned.

### **Column Selection**

Customize your view by selecting which columns to display on the dashboard. This feature allows you to focus on the data that is most relevant to your current needs, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

- Expand the vertical column selector on the right side of the table and select or deselect columns from your view. You can also drag and drop items in this list to change their order.

## **View Management**

### **Default Views**

By default, Airflip provides you with three default views in your Spreadsheet.

1. **Default**: Groups your spend transactions into Category Level 1 > Category Level 2 > Category Level 3 > Granular Category > Supplier.
2. **All Transactions:** Shows all spend transactions on the Airflip tool sorted by Total Amount. No groups or filter are applied.
3. **Suppliers:** Groups all spend transactions by supplier name.

### **Create and Save Views**

A view represents a set of saved table settings tailored to specific criteria. You can create and save new views by:

1. Select your desired columns, sorts, filters, and aggregations. 
2. Select the Eye icon above the table.
3. Click ‘Create new view’ to create a separate view or ‘Update current view’ to change the settings of your current view. 

### **Duplicate Views**

Duplicate existing views and use them as templates for new views. This feature is a time-saver and promotes consistency in data analysis approaches across various projects and teams. 

1. Start with a view you would like to duplicate and click the Eye icon. 
2. Click ‘Create new view’. This will copy all of the current view settings into a new view. 

### **Delete and Rename Views**

Manage your views effectively by deleting outdated views and renaming current ones to better reflect the ongoing changes in business strategies and user needs. 

1. Click the Eye icon, followed by ‘Edit Views’.
2. Click the Pencil icon to edit the view name, or the Trash icon to delete the view. Please note that default views cannot be renamed or deleted.

### **Data Persistence and Reversion**

Airflip ensures that any unsaved changes you make to your view settings are not lost when you reload the page, navigate back to your table using the back button or log out and back in; your most recent settings will persist. 

To revert any unsaved changes and return to the last saved state of a view, simply click the circle arrow icon on the right hand side above the table. This action will restore your view to its previously saved configuration.
