The Opportunities tab provides valuable insights into how vendor categories and suppliers are used across your organization and where improvements can be made.

By analyzing your spend transactions alongside our proprietary category taxonomy and research, our AI-driven insights infer how your company leverages each supplier. These insights are displayed in the "Likelihood of Use" column:

- **Likely**: There is a strong association between the supplier’s spend and the category, based on specific transaction data.
- **Possible**: There may be a link between the supplier’s spend and the category, suggested by both spend data and supplier details.
- **Sourcing Opportunity**: While there’s no direct spend tied to the category, our research highlights the supplier as a leader in that space. Since you already work with this supplier, it’s worth considering them for this category. For example, if you’re evaluating the Partnerships Management software category and have a contract with Salesforce for CRM software, Salesforce would be flagged as a "Sourcing Opportunity," indicating you might expand your contract to include Partnerships Management.

The data is available in two views: by **Category** and by **Supplier**.

### By Category

The Category View allows you to explore spend opportunities by specific categories, identifying which suppliers from your transactions are linked to each category. This helps you better understand spending patterns and the key suppliers associated with various categories.

The 'Filter Categories by Supplier' option lets you filter categories by supplier alongside other suppliers within the same categories. This allows for a comprehensive view of all categories where a supplier operates or has a sourcing opportunity.

**Examples**:

1. **Identify Categories with Sourcing Opportunities**: Use the filter in the 'Grouped Columns' column to search for a specific category. Expand the category row to view all associated suppliers and check for any sourcing opportunities.
    
    To see all categories with sourcing opportunities, clear all other filters and set the 'Likelihood of Use' filter to "Sourcing Opportunities."
    
2. **Analyze Sales Engagement Consolidation Opportunities**: Filter the 'Grouped Columns' for the Sales Engagement Software category. Expand the category to review suppliers marked as "Likely" to provide sales engagement services. This may reveal opportunities to consolidate suppliers and avoid duplication of services.

### By Supplier

The Supplier View enables you to focus on individual suppliers, exploring the categories they may be associated with based on your spend data. This is helpful for evaluating a supplier’s potential across multiple categories, whether for expanding relationships or consolidating services.

**Examples**:

1. **Evaluate Supplier Use in a Category**: To assess whether a supplier is used for a particular category, filter by the supplier name in the 'Grouped Columns' and review all entries where the 'Likelihood of Use' is "Likely."
2. **Discover New Opportunities with a Supplier**: If you are approaching a renewal or negotiation with a supplier, filter by the supplier and look for rows marked as "Sourcing Opportunity." This indicates the supplier is a category leader, and expanding the scope of the supplier contract to this category may be a viable alternative to a higher-cost supplier.
