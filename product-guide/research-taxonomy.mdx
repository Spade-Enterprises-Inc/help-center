The Airflip research taxonomy is broken down into Departments, Parent Categories, Child Categories, Products, Suppliers and Market Leaders.

### Departments

Departments represent broad functional areas within a business, such as Marketing, Sales, or IT. Research is tailored to the needs and challenges typically encountered in each department.

### Parent Categories

Parent categories define common business problems that child categories help solve. These are generally used for broad, platform-based solutions. A category is classified as a parent if it has a parent-child relationship with other categories. For example Quote Management Software is a parent category that contains CPQ Software, Quote-to-Cash Software, Proposal Software and Pricing Software.

### Child Categories

Child categories usually refer to more specialized, "point solutions" that address specific business needs. Child categories are either linked to a parent category or act as a standalone categories. For example, Conversation Intelligence Software is a child category under Sales Accelleration Software.

### Products

Categories are mapped to companies at the product level. For example Salesforce Sales Cloud is mapped to CRM Software whereas Salesforce Marketing Cloud is mapped to Marketing Automation Software.

### Market Leaders

Each product is evaluated based on its performance in a specific category. Market Leaders are products we have identified as top performers within a specific category. For example, ZoomInfo Sales is a leader in both Sales Intelligence and Buyer Intent Data Software, with separate research for each category.

### Suppliers

Suppliers are companies or organizational entities that offer various products. A company may have one or more associated products within different categories. For example, both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud are products offered by the supplier Salesforce.
