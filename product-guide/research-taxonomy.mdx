The Airflip research taxonomy is organized into Departments, High-Level Categories, Subcategories, Products, Suppliers, and Market Leaders.

### Departments

Departments represent broad functional areas within a business, such as Marketing, Sales, or IT Infrastructure. Research is tailored to the needs and challenges typically encountered in each department.

### High-Level Categories and Subcategories

High-level categories represent broad business challenges or needs, typically addressed by comprehensive, platform-based solutions. These categories serve as umbrella terms for more specialized solutions that target specific needs. Subcategories are specialized solutions that address more specific business challenges. They either belong to a broader high-level category or function independently.

For example, **Conversion Rate Optimization Tools** is a high-level category that encompasses A/B Testing Tools, Heatmap Tools, Session Replay Software, Product Analytics Software, Customer Journey Mapping Tools and Landing Page Builders.

### Products

Products are specific supplier offerings that are linked to various categories. For example, **Salesforce Sales Cloud** is classified under CRM Software, while **Salesforce Marketing Cloud** is categorized within Marketing Automation Software.

### Market Leaders

Each product is evaluated based on its performance in a specific category. Market Leaders are identified by Airflip as top performers within a category. For example, **ZoomInfo Sales** is a leader in both Sales Intelligence and Buyer Intent Data Software, with separate research for each category.

### Suppliers

Suppliers refer to companies or organizations that offer various products. A company may have multiple products spanning different categories. For instance, Salesforce offers both **Salesforce Sales Cloud** and **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.
