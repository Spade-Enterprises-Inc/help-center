The Airflip research taxonomy is organized into Departments, High-Level Categories, Subcategories, Products, Suppliers, and Market Leaders.

### Departments

Departments represent broad functional areas within a business, such as Marketing, Sales, or IT. Research is tailored to the needs and challenges typically encountered in each department.

### High-Level Categories

High-level categories represent broad business challenges or needs, typically addressed by comprehensive, platform-based solutions. These categories serve as umbrella terms for more specialized solutions that target specific needs. For example, Quote Management Software is a high-level category that encompasses CPQ Software, Quote-to-Cash Software, Proposal Software, and Pricing Software.

### Subcategories

Subcategories are specialized solutions that address more specific business challenges. They either belong to a broader high-level category or function independently. For instance, Conversation Intelligence Software is a subcategory under Sales Acceleration Software.

### Products

Products are specific supplier offerings that are linked to various categories. For example, Salesforce Sales Cloud is classified under CRM Software, while Salesforce Marketing Cloud is categorized within Marketing Automation Software.

### Market Leaders

Each product is evaluated based on its performance in a specific category. Market Leaders are identified by Airflip as top performers within a category. For example, ZoomInfo Sales is a leader in both Sales Intelligence and Buyer Intent Data Software, with separate research for each category.

### Suppliers

Suppliers refer to companies or organizations that offer various products. A company may have multiple products spanning different categories. For instance, Salesforce offers both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.
