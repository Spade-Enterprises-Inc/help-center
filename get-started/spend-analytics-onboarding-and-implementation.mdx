title: Spend Analytics Onboarding and Implementation
---

# Welcome to Airflip

Thank you for choosing us as your spend analytics solution. Designed for high-revenue companies in North America, we’ll be able to provide your team with advanced AI classification, customizable dashboards, and actionable insights – all in under one month, with under 10 hours of effort for your team.

# Action Items

1. **Schedule a kickoff (30 minutes)**: We’ll use this time to confirm your specific requirements, the detailed integration plan, and answer any questions you may have about the onboarding process.

2. **IT introduction (5 minutes)**: Introduce us to your IT department via email. We’ll then send them a document that includes the requirements and estimated man-hours, so they can create project management documentation (e.g. Jira tickets) and add it into their queue. One requirement will be setting up a shared Slack or Microsoft Teams channel.

3. **Export your data as flat files (1-2 hours)**: To achieve quicker time-to-value, we recommend your team send us your data as flat files, so that we are not blocked on IT. This should take under 10 minutes per system, and your Client Services Representative can be on a Zoom call with a team member to walk you through the step-by-step data export process for each of your systems. Feel free to send our team any documentation that you can think of if it might inform better spend analytics, and we will parse through on our end.

4. **Schedule short-term feedback sessions (2.5 hours over 2 weeks)**: Until you are satisfied with your deliverable, we are open to having daily stand-ups to confirm that you are able to receive quick time-to-value on this engagement. This generally lasts for a 2-week period.

5. **Schedule ongoing review sessions**: Over the rest of the contract, you can use these sessions to engage with our team to customize your solution and ensure it meets your unique business requirements. We like to meet at least quarterly with our customers, and are happy to meet monthly.

# Improving Classification Precision

### Introduction to Our AI Model

Your spend classification is powered by a sophisticated AI model that incorporates the latest OpenAI models, and leverages Airflip’s proprietary dataset that includes supplier news events, marketing content, user reviews, and expert research synthesis on more than 100k suppliers. The breadth of our data coverage ensures that our classifications are not only precise but also relevant to your unique business context.

### Manual Edits

- **Taxonomy Customization**: Users have the ability to manually adjust classification taxonomies, making it possible to tailor the AI's understanding of your spend categories to better fit your company's structure.
- **Reclassification Requests**: After making manual edits to the taxonomy, you can request a reclassification of specific transactions. This ensures that any changes you make are reflected across your spend data, maintaining consistency and accuracy in your analytics.

### Rule Engine

- **Domain Knowledge Application**: The rule engine feature allows you to apply your own domain knowledge to override AI-generated classifications. This is particularly useful in cases where your company has specific categorization standards or unique business rules that the AI may not initially align with.
- **Flexibility and Precision**: By setting up custom rules, you can ensure that the AI model's output precisely matches your organizational needs, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of spend analysis reports.

### Upcoming Feature: Feedback per Transaction

- **Enhanced Interaction**: Soon, our platform will introduce a feature that allows users to leave feedback on individual transactions. This will provide a direct way to inform the AI model of any discrepancies or preferred classifications on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Each piece of feedback will contribute to the continuous learning of our AI model, ensuring that it becomes more aligned with your company's specific spending patterns and classification preferences over time. This iterative process not only improves the model's accuracy but also personalizes it to your organizational needs.
